R9.2 superclass and subclass
Superclass works such that all subclasses inherit all methods and objects from the superclass. It would not be effective
to separate the appliances into separate classes when they all share similiar attributes going against the principle of
subclassing which is to inherit attributes and methods from the superclass. You are adding additional complexity by
using superclass and subclass which can easily be efficiently organized byu using a general SmallAppliance class with
distinguising attrivutes for each product

R9.4 SavingsAccount
The methods in SavingsAccount class inherits the deposit() and getBalance() methods from the BankAccount superclass.
The SavingsAccount class overrides the withdraw() and monthEnd() methods from the BankAccount superclass. It adds a
