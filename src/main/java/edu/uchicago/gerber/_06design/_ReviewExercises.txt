R12.1 OO Analysis and Design
The steps int eh rpocess of OO design the character reccomends is
1. Gatehr requirements
2. Use CRC cards to find classes responsibilites and collaborators
3. Use UML diagrams to record class relationships
4. Use javadoc to document mehtod behavior
5. Implement your program

R12.2 OO Analysis and Design
The rule of thumbs for finding classes is to look for nouns in the problem description  or requirements. They often
represent entities or objects in the program.

R12.3 OO Analysis and Design
The rule of thumb for finding these methods is to look for verbs in the task description and then match the verbs to the
appropriate objects.

R12.8 Relationships
UML Diagram
                                    Coin
 - holds coins (store value/ name)           Cash Register
 - provide coin value


                                    Cash Register
 - Accept coin payment                        Coin
 - Calculate Total payment
 - Track Total

R12.9 CRC Quiz

                                    Quiz
 - manage collection of questions            Question
 - add question to quiz
 - keep track pof progression

                                     Question
