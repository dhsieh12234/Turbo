R10.5 Events
An event object is the instance of a class that provides information about a speciic event, such as a click.
The event listener object are instances of classes that you must provide with instructions that you want to have executed
whne the event occurs. The event source is the UI component which generates a particular event.

R10.6 actionPerformed
The actionPerformed method is called immediately after the event is created, like a button click. .

R10.11 Inner class and event-listeners
We use inner clases for event listeners because it allows us to access insatnce variables and methods located in the
listener class. This is especially helpful for organizational purposes and not allowing for a lot of variables to be
recieved in teh constructor or method arguments. If Java did not allow inner classes, we could impleemnt event listeners
in two separate classes but with a lot of variabels in constructors and methods.

R10.14 Object hierarchies
- A method declared in JTExtArea: append(String str)
- A mehtod that JTextArea inherits from JTextComponent: setText(String t)
- A method that JTextArea inherits from JComponenet: setBackground(Color c)

R10.22 Graphic methods
I would modify the method by instead of doing setCOlor(color.green) I would allow for the user to input 2 colors and
fill in the color of the sides with the color of their choice.

R11.2 Layout managers
Each container has a layout manager which determines how components are laid out. This is advantegeous since it helps
you control the layout fo the user-interface componenets insetad of simply doing it from left to right. Layout Manager
provide a more flexible, adaptabel and maintainable approach to the user interface layout instead of manually specifying
component positions

R11.11 ButtonGroup
You need the button gropu for radio buttons and not check boxes since for radio buttons you can only have one options
checked while for check boxes you can have more than 1 checked. The button gropu enforces this by grouping the radio
button togther, deselcting any other selected radio buttons in that group when a new one is selected.

R11.19 Types of Events
ActioneEvent are generated from radio buttons, check boexes and combo bocxes when a user sleects an item. It doesn't
matter what is checked as all componenets will notify the same listener object. Mousepressed is triggered when the
mouse button is pressed and actions are processed. So for ActionEvent the click has to be with interaction on an
interactive element such as button, menu, etc. while MouseEvent is triggered by specific mouse interactions such as
clicking, pressing, releasing etc.

R11.21 ActionListener versus MouseListener
You can only click on an interactive element such as button, menu, etc, while for the mouse you can click, release,
press, entered, and exit.
